CSC360 Assignment 2 Deliverable 1

Questions:
1.  There will be one thread for each train, and a main controller thread that keeps track of timings and prints to stdout.

2.  There is an overall controller thread that keeps a queue of train departure order.

3.  There will be one mutex to guard the main track (current_train).

4.  No the main thread will not be idle. It will be responsible for queueing the trains and sending them on their way.

5.  Stations will be represented by a heap based priority queue.

6.  Only the main thread will modify the data structures, so only it will have access to them.

7.  How many convars are you going to use? For each conver:
	a) describe the condition
	b) which mutex is associated with it, why
	c) What operation should be performed once 
	   pthread_cond_wait() has been unblocked?

8. In 15 lines or less briefly sketch the overall algorithm you will 	use. 
    You may use sentences such as: 
      If train is loaded, get station mutex, put into queue, release station mutex.
